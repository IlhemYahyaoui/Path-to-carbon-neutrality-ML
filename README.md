# Learning from Emissions: A Predictive Study on the Road to Carbon Neutrality

# Path-to-carbon-neutrality-ML
A machine learning-driven analysis of CO₂ emissions per capita across countries and years, exploring the key drivers of emissions and forecasting progress toward carbon neutrality. This project uses various ML models and feature importance techniques to identify impactful factors and build interpretable predictive models.

##  Project Overview

This project explores the drivers of CO₂ emissions per capita across different countries and years using machine learning models. By analyzing historical emissions data, we aim to identify the most impactful factors influencing emissions and build interpretable models that forecast emission trends. Ultimately, the project provides insights that can guide policy-making and assess progress toward carbon neutrality.
